# Accountability-Keeper
A simple php and mysql site which allows you to record what you do each day. It keeps you accountable. A user can create activities which need to be done either weekly or daily. The user can then use these activities to create a schedule to follow. There is a calendar which can be used select a day to see what has been scheduled for that day and set whether it has been completed or not.

## Deployment
This project can be deployed to any web server which can use PHP. A MySQL database will also be needed to store data.
A sql file has been provided, which can be used to create and setup the database properly.
Bootstrap and JQuery needs to be downloaded or change the lines in header.html to retrieve them from a CDN.

##Note
This project does not have adequate security. Parsing and checking of user input and better sql queries have been skipped as this site is just a side project for fun.
